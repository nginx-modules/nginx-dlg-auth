nginx-dlg-auth
==============

NGINX module for delegating authentication and authorization to an HTTP gateway.

nginx-dlg-auth combines [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk) and [iron](https://github.com/hueniverse/iron) to enable authentication and
authorization using encapsulated tokens.

The token format has been inspired by [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz) but is
different for now, because in the long run, I think I have somewhat different use
cases than Oz is aiming at.

This is all somewhat experimental and will evolve over the next months.

The token format right now is

    {"client":"test01","pwd":"v8(9D1A>7n9J<","scope":["NEWS","BLOG"],\
    "rw":false,"exp":1405688331,"hawkAlgorithm":"sha256"}

and combines password and algorithm to be used with Hawk as well as access rights
and token expiration time.


Status
======

The module has been used in a production environment for several months and version 1.5 fixes some
minor security issues.

Installation
============

This NGINX module needs [ciron](https://github.com/algermissen/ciron)
and [hawkc](https://github.com/algermissen/hawkc). Build them separately
and adjust nginx-dlg-auth's config file to point to libciron.a and libhawkc.a.

Also, copy the header files ciron.h and hawkc.h to a standard header file location
on your machine.

Configure NGINX build like this:


    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/code/nginx-dlg-auth

You may also want to add the library file to $LINK_DEPS to make
sure nginx will correctly relink itself on make if library
changes."


NGINX Module Configuration
==========================

    dlg_auth <realm>

    dlg_auth_iron_pwd <password>  OR <passwordID> <password>

    dlg_auth_allowed_clock_skew <allowed-skew-in-seconds>

    dlg_auth_host <hostname>

    dlg_auth_port <port>

## dlg_auth

Enables access delegation checking. The parameter is the authentication realm.
Tickets must inlcude this realm in their scope to gain access.

If dlg_auth is missing or if realm is 'off', the module will not be enabled.
The 'off' value can be used to disable authentication checking in locations
that have parent locations that enable checking.

## dlg_auth_iron_pwd

You can use dlg_auth_iron_pwd to either set a single password, or to provide
a set of passwordIds and password to enable password rotation.


## dlg_auth_allowed_clock_skew

Explicitly set the allowed clock skew in seconds. The default is 1 second.

If you set this to 0 clock skew will not be checed. This is useful for
monitoring checks.

## dlg_auth_host <hostname>

Explicitly set the host used for signature validation.

## dlg_auth_port <port>

Explicitly set the port used for signature validation.


Examples

    dlg_auth NEWS
    dlg_auth_iron_pwd z3$0O1Y]8x3T+;
    dlg_auth_allowed_clock_skew 10



    dlg_auth NEWS
    dlg_auth_iron_pwd 100922 z3$0O1Y]8x3T+;
    dlg_auth_iron_pwd 776277 w1|6Q3V]7s8R);
    dlg_auth_iron_pwd 199289 i7(5P3D.4f0D-;
    dlg_auth_iron_pwd 662552 a6>0K0G]8z7B=;
    dlg_auth_allowed_clock_skew 10


You must not use passwords that contain ';' characters. This would probably confuse
nginx config parser.


Variables
=========

The module sets a number of variables to make per request handling information available
in later NGINX phases. For example, these variables can be used for logging which client
(and/or user) made the request and, possibly, for which resource owner the pertaining
grant had been issued.

These variables are available:

- $dlg_auth_client The client ID of the client that made the request.
- $dlg_auth_expires The expire timestamp of the ticket used for the request.
- $dlg_auth_clockskew The skew of the client clock relative to the server clock.
